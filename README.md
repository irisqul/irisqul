### Hi! I'm Irina Rudnichenko ðŸ‘‹

I am fullstack QA engineer currently working at Rubetek. We develop IOT solutions and I am responsible for automation and functional testing (back- and frontend).

I have a degree in Culture and Urban Studies, but then found myself captivated by testing software. My background in Linguistics helps me to learn new languages, including Python. I really enjoy finding mistakes and mistranslations from human to computer signs.

I have took half-year courses on ethical web-hacking, basic algorythms with Python and practiced in bulding frameworks for automation.
